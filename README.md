# Bearcat Events
As Students of Northwest Missouri State University are back to in-person classes, we would like to create an application that reminds students about the events happening in the University. The events can be from any Organization in the university like SAC, ISO, ACM, ISA etc. The main purpose of this application is to encourage students to participate in all events.
